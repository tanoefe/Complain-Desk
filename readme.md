About Complain Desk
--------------------------------------------
Ever tried complaining to your Institution or a Service Provider about a nagging issue you are facing? To solve most of these problems, requires the complainant to lodge a complain and follow up on it, if he truly wants it to be resolved.This is where the problem lies. Apart from human error, the person complainted to forgetting  or the individual being flooded with the same issues which someone has complained about, resolving problems and issues could be a tiring and frustrating job. Not to mention, that dark and gloomy period of isolation, where you have no idea as to the progress that has been made towards getting your issue reolved. 

A large population or customer base of the service could easily overload the individual being complained to. The distance between the complainantâ€™s location and the office of the Institution or Service Provider, i.e, the  great fixer, and the daunting task to ensure it has been resolved and it has not been tossed aside,  hinders a smooth Customer experience and the Institutions ability to effectively tackle its problems.

Complain Desk seeks to reslove this,  by offering a web application to tackle the problem of Customers or Users complaints management in a simple but efficient way.

The goal is to easily place in the hands of customers or users a simple interface in order to make complaints to the right authorities easier and efficiently. It also provides the opportunity to scan through earlier resolved issues or pending issues, this would prevent the institutions or organizations from being notified of the same issue several times. While allowing to track the status of complaints made and alerting the complainants when it is resolved or alerting the institution when it has been ignored. 

On the institution or organizational side of things, this application prevents the institution from being overloaded with different complaints in a day and having no way to put a track on all of them. This allows for the appropriate individual to be alerted, reminded, ask for progress report on behalf of the complainant and inform the complainant as soon as these has been resolved. More importantly allowing for  institutions to make improvement to their institution in areas where it is flawed.


Complain Desk provides a clean user interface using the Laravel framework which allows for a simple and classic design which users can easily understand. While also utilizing the simple power of SMS and email notifications in order to keep its users informed in relation to progress towards resolving their complaints. 

ComplainDesk in no way makes this assertion that there are not other means to make a complain. Either by virtue of a suggestion box, walking to the office of the appropriate individual, spamming the life out of the service provider with calls, or it may be just by sending an email to the appropriate authority. But we the authors being part of institutions, and having a first hand experience on how devastating these problems could be,  strongly hold the view that this method of making a complain is what is wrong with the complain system.  Especially for  large institutions or organizations, a simple enquiry or complain could be extremely frustrating , unnecessarily long and tedious 

This application is what we believe to be among the things missing in our various Institutions and Organizations in Ghana which would attempt to fix the problem and  benefit both the Customers or Users and the institution.
